### Hi there 

I am a Quality Engineer, an enthusiast of automated front-end and back-end testing, with experience in frameworks such as Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. I also have knowledge in performance, security, and mobile testing with Appium.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and [Gists](https://gist.github.com/AndradeTC86) where I have published my article in Portuguese, English, and Spanish.

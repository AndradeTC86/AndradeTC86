### Welcome to my Github Profile

I am a Quality Engineer passionate about testing, with experience in front-end and back-end test automation using frameworks such as Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. My expertise also extends to performance testing with JMeter, security testing with Burp Suite, and mobile testing with Appium.

Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my projects and studies. Additionally, check out my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/AndradeTC86), where Iâ€™ve published an article â€” available in Portuguese, English, and Spanish â€” featuring a proof of concept comparing Cypress, Selenium, and Playwright. This article was part of my final project for the Agile Testing specialization course at CESAR School.

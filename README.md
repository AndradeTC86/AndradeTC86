### Hi there 

I am a Quality Engineer, an enthusiast of automated front-end and back-end testing, with experience in frameworks such as Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright. I also have knowledge in performance, security, and mobile testing with Appium.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and [Gists](https://gist.github.com/AndradeTC86) where I have published an article in Portuguese :heavy_check_mark:, English :soon:, and Spanish :soon: with a proof of concept for comparison between the frameworks Cypress, Selenium and Playwright, whch was my final project in the specialization course in Agile Testing on CESAR School.
